## Goals

My goal is to get a position of Junior Mobile Developer in an international company. 

It’s very important for me to have the possibility of evolution and progress. 

I just want to solve different tasks in  some big project. I dream that all my tasks are not routine and boring. 

I wish my Team Lead talks that I’m one of the best developers in his team.

## Few words about me. 

I’ve 10 year experience as a developer in the 1C Enterprise system. 4 or 5 years ago I began to study java. 

In 2019/2020 i was working as a Junior java developer in the small group of developers in the NGO "Treasure house of projects" company. 

We were developing the online CRM solution. The main thing of this CRM system was that clients of our customer should pay for service 

on a regular basis, such as we pay for the internet or TV.  In this project I used Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring MVC, ThymeLeaf, 

FlyWay, Bootstrap, Mockito and some other technologies.
