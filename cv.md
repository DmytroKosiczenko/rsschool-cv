## Goals

My goal is to get a position of Junior Mobile Developer in an international company. 
It is very important for me to have the possibility of evolution and progress. 
I want to solve different tasks in  some big project. I dream hat all my tasks are not routine and boring.
I wish my Team Lead talks that I am one of the best developers in his team.

## Few words about me. 

I have 10 year experience as a developer in the 1C Enterprise system. 4 or 5 years ago I began to study java. 
In 2020 i was working as a Junior java developer in the small group of developers in the NGO *Treasure house of projects* company. 
We were developing the online CRM solution. The main thing of this CRM system was that clients of our customer should pay for service 
on a regular basis, such as we pay for the internet or TV.  In this project I used Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring MVC, ThymeLeaf, 
FlyWay, Bootstrap, Mockito and some other technologies.
